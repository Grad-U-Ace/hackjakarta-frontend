# Grad-U-Ace' Hack Jakarta Frontend
## GrabFood Chatbot

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Overview
The GrabFood Chatbot aims to revolutionize the food ordering experience by offering personalized recommendations to users and actionable insights to merchants. Leveraging AI, this chatbot enhances user engagement, reduces bounce rates, and drives economic growth for merchants.

## Key Features
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Tailored food suggestions based on user inputs such as cravings, distances, and price.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Refine searches by cuisine, user's review, and more.
- **Merchant Visibility:** Small merchants featured in recommendations to increase their exposure.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
